# What are we looking for?

We are looking for people with some of the following modest requirements

* You should have at least 6 months or longer experience in any programming language
* You should have been involved in the development process of at least 1 project
* You should have great verbal and written communication skills
* You should have a friendly demeanor and collaborative in your tasks
* You should have an inclination to learn new things while building cool stuff
* You should have an expertise to find solutions from popular search engines
* You should have an ambition to be an open-source contributor
* You should have an experience in the prominent office enterprise applications
* You should have an experience in the prominent graphic design suites

We are looking for only some of the above stated requirements. We understand that it would be very unfair if we ask a cybersecurity analyst to have an experience in design suites and a frontend designer to have an experience in C++. We would not do that. You are in for a quick chat about your interests and objectives if you satisfy any three (or more) of the above stated requirements before we welcome you in our community.

!!! warning "Keep in mind"
    In picking the three modest requirements from above, kindly consider two technical skills and one non-technical skill. Of course this is a bare minimum and you are free to have as many skills up your sleeve as you want.

We will try our best to avoid unpleasantness so kindly note

* You should not look for any kind of monetary advantage from any contribution
* You should not possess the know-it-all attitude
* You should not be selective about the tasks that have been assigned to you
* You should not be always looking for a smooth-sailing experience and certainty
* You should not avoid risks and dangers that may come during contribution
* You should not be irregular with meeting with your stated commitments
* You should not have a desire to own projects made together by the community
