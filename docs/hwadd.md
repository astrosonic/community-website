# How can you contribute?

This is how you can contribute to our open-source community. We have a total of seven divisions with their own distinct sets of skills and expertise. If you think you fall in it, you are more than welcome to fulfill those tasks. These divisions would not divide you into teams though as teams are purely based on what project you are up to. It is certainly possible to have people from multiple divisions to be in the same team just as much as it is possible to build a team entirely with members from a single division.

!!! warning "Roles"
    A community member can either take part in up to three divisions listed below as a passive member or up to one division listed below as an active member. An active member is given a position of responsibility but is limited to be in a single division. While a passive member can increase their scope of contribution by being available in three different divisions.

* **Architecture Division**  
You have a strong sense about how things should work and why they should work the way you specify them to. You are good at making charts and seeing the bigger picture. We can expect valuable insights and idea reviews from you for you can pretty much visualize them before they are even implemented.

!!! danger "Positions of responsibility are now OPEN to all members"
    For the architecture division, we are looking for **project managers**, **software engineers**, **support engineers** and a **team lead**. Interested members are requested to contact via official channels to convey their willingness.

* **Development Division**  
You are good with programming languages and your logic hits bullseye most of the time. You like to spend countless hours in front of black screens of IDEs and nothing brings you more joy than a snippet working just as expected in the very first run. We can expect rich codes and optimal logic from you.

* **Design Division**  
You feel there is something wrong with how things work right now and you can definitely walk the path of innovation to make it better. You love designing creative and efficient solutions. We can expect massive brainstorming and new ideas from you for you know what should be worked on.

    For the design division, we are looking for **project managers**, **software engineers**, **support engineers** and a **team lead**. Interested members are requested to contact via official channels to convey their willingness.

* **Frontend Division**  
You understand the fact that a good project would not make a great impact among the end-user and other friendly communities if it fails to look and feel good. You have an affinity to web development and we expect you to spin a rather joyless piece of code into an eyecandy with your magical skills.

* **Service Division**  
You realize that there is a lot of code and systems that perform shabbily and someone has to get their hands dirty to make things right. You feel right at home when you run those benchmarks and lint evaluation your code. We expect you to test, report and fix bugs as and when you come across them.

    For the service division, we are looking for **project managers**, **software engineers**, **support engineers** and a **team lead**. Interested members are requested to contact via official channels to convey their willingness.

* **Documentation Division**  
You see that there are a lot of people around who cannot quite get into development for things are not quite explained to them. You take it as your responsibility to bridge the gap and make things lucid. We expect you to write project documentation in a way people would clearly understand them

* **Outreach Division**  
You know that a community is better off with more people and friends to goof around with. You get it that it is fun to build things together and have fun while doing it but the more people you have, the merrier it will be. We expect you to speak for our community and reach out to interested people.
